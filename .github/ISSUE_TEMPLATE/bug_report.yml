    id: dns-adblock
    attributes:
      label: Are you using a custom DNS server or ad blocker?
      description: |
        DNS services like AdGuard or system-wide ad blockers can interfere with how Grindr loads certain elements (e.g. cookie prompts, albums, etc.). 
        These may cause bugs that aren't related to GrindrPlus itself.

        ‚ö†Ô∏è Some DNS resolvers may set long TTL (time-to-live) values, meaning their effects can persist even after disabling them. 
        A **device reboot** may be required to fully clear the DNS cache.

        Please try disabling your custom DNS or ad blocker, **reboot your device**, and test again before submitting this report.
      options:
        - No, I'm not using any custom DNS or ad blocker
        - Yes, but I have tested with it disabled and rebooted; the bug still occurs
        - Yes, but I have not tested with it disabled and rebooted

        Sometimes the module logs alone aren't enough to determine the root cause of an issue. Android system logs can provide additional context about what's happening at the system level.
        
        If you're comfortable with it, take logs and grep for `Grindr`, `LSPosed`, `LSPatch` if possible. For information about how to capture these logs, check the LineageOS website [here](https://wiki.lineageos.org/how-to/logcat/).
